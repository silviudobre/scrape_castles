### About
> This project provides a handy way to collect, transform and store information from a Wikipedia page about castles in Romania. 

### Libraries
> - For HTTP requests, the script uses the 'requests' library. 
> - 'Beautifulsoup4' was the choice for scraping the HTML page.
> - To have a more accurate description of the rows, I've used the Geocoding API from Nominatim to get the coordinates of each city.
